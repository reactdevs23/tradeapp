interest and speculative momentum. The price has surged in the last 24

relative to market cap, increasing the risk of slippage and volatility.
The token exhibits classic meme coin behaviorâ€”rapid adoption, fast
turnover, and hype-driven price action. While short-term trends are
bullish, sustainability is questionable without continuous inflow and
demand. Overall, it's a high-risk, high-reward asset likely driven
by community hype or social catalysts.`;
